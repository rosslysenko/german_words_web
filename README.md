# German Words Learning Web App
#### Video Demo: [URL to your video demo]
#### Description:
Because of the war in Ukraine, many refugees have gone to different countries, including Germany. 
In order to help them integrate and overcome the language barrier more quickly, this app was created. 
Studies on the frequency of words in a language show that 80% of everyday conversations use a small vocabulary of words. Michael West's study (“A General Service List of English Words”), published in 1953.
Michael West developed a list of frequently used English words (General Service List), which includes about 2000 words. He showed that most conversations and texts are covered by a relatively small vocabulary.
George Kiparsky's work and statistical studies by 20th century linguists: These studies revealed that in any language, the most frequent 1000-2000 words cover a significant portion of everyday communication.
Zipf's Principle (“Zipf's Law”): This is the mathematical principle that the frequency of words in a language is not evenly distributed - a small number of words occur very frequently, while the rest are much less frequent.
This research shows that studying the most frequently used words in a language is the most effective way to improve language proficiency.
For this project, I have selected 1125 of the most frequently used words that should help you learn German.
